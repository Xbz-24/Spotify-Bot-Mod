### Please leave a star for the project. This project is free and open source.  You can leave a star from the top right. 

This project is a Spotify listener bot. With this bot, it automatically logs into Spotify web and then opens the Spotify song link it asks you for, pressing the play button. The foundation of the project is Python Selenium.

The project reflects as a listener to you. The project is new and will be supported with updates, but my sole motivation is for you to give the project a star.

The program is new, still in development, please report any bugs to us on the discord server. ⚠️

## Usage ⚙

- **After completing the installation process, make sure that you have successfully installed the chromedriver.**

- **My advice to you is not to use the keyboard and mouse before all processes are finished. In some places, the program uses the escape key.**
